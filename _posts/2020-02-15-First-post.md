This is the first blog post on my blog. The blog is a demo blog for the Github Learning Lab course I am taking on how to set up and use github pages with jekyll. Eventually I will be able to host my cool websites from Github, but I'll probably use it mostly to host my eportfolio page. Check back for more updates!
